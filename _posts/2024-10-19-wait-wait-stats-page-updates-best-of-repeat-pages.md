Version 2.13.0 of the [Wait Wait Stats Library](https://github.com/questionlp/wwdtm) has been published, and it includes new show methods for retrieving show information and details for Best Of, Repeat, and Best Of Repeat shows.

The library has since been updated to version 2.14.0 which `best_of_repeats` is renamed to `repeat_best_ofs` with the former now an alias for the latter.

The new version of the Stats Library also introduces initial support for [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/) and replaces the Pallets Flask Sphinx theme with Furo. Updated documentation is available at [docs.wwdt.me](https://docs.wwdt.me)

The new version of the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me) uses the updated Stats Library to include new corresponding [Best Of](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/best-ofs), [Repeat](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/repeats) and [Repeat Best Of](https://stats.wwdt.me/shows/repeat-best-ofs) Shows pages.

Release notes for both are available on GitHub:
