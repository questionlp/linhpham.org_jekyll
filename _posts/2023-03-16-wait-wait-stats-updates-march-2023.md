With the release of [Materialize](https://materializeweb.com/) version 1.2.2, I have updated both the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) and [Wait Wait Graphs Site](https://graphs.wwdt.me/) to use the new version of the CSS framework.

In addition to updating the version of Materialize for the Graphs Site, the [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) graphing library was also updated to 1.20.0.

Lastly, the version of Pure CSS used by the [Wait Wait Reports Site](https://reports.wwdt.me/) was also updated to 2.2.0.

The changes have also been published to the respective project repositories on GitHub:
