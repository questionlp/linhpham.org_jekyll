June has, so far, been a pretty quiet month for any development work for the suite of Wait Wait Stats-related sites. Work and other projects have kept me a lot busier than I would have liked; and, I don't see that changing too much in the coming months.

I was able to sneak out an update for the [Wait Wait Stats API](https://api.wwdt.me/) to update a few dependencies which had some important updates and fixes, including security vulnerabilities.

More information is available in the project's [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/questionlp/api.wwdt.me_v2/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

I am excited to be going to the Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! taping here in Portland, Oregon on Thursday, July 20th.
