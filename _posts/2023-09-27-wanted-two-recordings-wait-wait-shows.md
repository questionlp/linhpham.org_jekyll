Over the past two months, I have received the recordings for the [Wait Wait Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org/) shows aired in 1998 and 1999 from the [Special Collections](https://www.lib.umd.edu/collections/special) at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/). There was one recording they had listed for Wait Wait for May 23, 1998, but the program had been preempted by an airing of "Rock & Roll America."

The folks at the Special Collections could not track down any other records for the Wait Wait show that aired on that date.

Looking through the shows that I had been able to download in past years, with shows starting from mid-January 2000, I found that I have another gap: the show that aired on January 8, 2000. I had requested the folks at the Special Collections to see if they had any information for that show in their archives, but I am still awaiting a response.

With that said, I am asking anyone if they have a recording of either the Wait Don't Tell Me show that aired on May 23, 1998, or the show that aired on January 8, 2000. I would also like to know if any contacts at NPR member stations aired those shows and if they have any recordings available.

I would love to be able to collect information and data for both of those shows and close up those two gaps. I am so close to being able to enter information for all Wait Wait shows from the first show aired in January 1998 through today.
