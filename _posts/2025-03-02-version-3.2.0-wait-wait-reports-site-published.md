After I published my "[Wait Wait Stats Wrapped 2024](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/albums/72177720322647930)" project on my Mastodon, Bluesky, and (now-deleted) Instagram accounts, I started building reports based on "Wait Wait Stats Wrapped", as well as a few new reports that I have been meaning to build. Those new reports and a number of other changes are now published with version 3.2.0 of the [Wait Wait Reports Site](https://reports.wwdt.me/). This blog post will go over some of the new reports and updates.

### Design and Visual Updates

When the Reports Site migrated from using [Pure CSS](https://pure-css.github.io/) to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) with version 3.0, all of the reports were ported over with minimal changes in design and functionality. After the migration was completed, I started to look at ways to incorporate Bootstrap components into reports and remove the need for forms to return data by segments. One of those components that I incorporated was the [accordion component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/accordion/).

<div class="row">
    <div class="col col-lg-6">
        <figure class="figure">
            <a target="_blank" href="/assets/images/waitwait/reports-v320/scorekeepers-introductions-old.png">
            <img src="/assets/images/waitwait/reports-v320/scorekeepers-introductions-old.png" class="img-fluid border" alt="Previous version of the 'Scorekeeper Introductions' report">
            </a>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                Previous version of the "Scorekeeper Introductions" report with list of scorekeepers at the top and tables for each scorekeeper
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="col col-lg-6">
        <figure class="figure">
            <a target="_blank" href="/assets/images/waitwait/reports-v320/scorekeepers-introductions-new.png">
            <img src="/assets/images/waitwait/reports-v320/scorekeepers-introductions-new.png" class="img-fluid border" alt="New version of the 'Scorekeeper Introductions' report">
            </a>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                New version of the "Scorekeeper Introductions" report with collapsible sections for each scorekeeper
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

With the accordion component, I could update reports to show multiple groups on the same page. This gives the viewer the ability to expand one or more segments while keeping the rest collapsed. The benefits of using an accordion include: removing the need for forms for a number of reports, having all of the data available in a cleaner format, and not needing to have two browser windows open to view two groups at the same time. The last item is a nice win when viewing reports on a phone or a tablet.

Groups that do not have any associated data are visually differentiated (using the browser's built-in styling for elements with the `disabled` element set and removing expand and collapse icons) and have the `aria-disabled` property set to `true`.

The incorporation of the accordion component does not remove the use of forms for all reeports. There are reports where using forms to select and view multiple panelists or set filters on the returned data is required.

The "Panelists vs Panelists: All" report is one that also benefits from the use of the accordion component with the removal of the secondary navigation elements (side bar for larger screens or a list at the top for smaller screens).

<div class="row">
    <div class="col col-lg-6">
        <figure class="figure">
            <a target="_blank" href="/assets/images/waitwait/reports-v320/panelist-vs-panelist-all-old.png">
            <img src="/assets/images/waitwait/reports-v320/panelist-vs-panelist-all-old.png" class="img-fluid border" alt="Previous version of the 'Panelist vs Panelist: All' report">
            </a>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                Previous version of the "Panelist vs Panelist: All" report with a list of panelists on the side
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="col col-lg-6">
        <figure class="figure">
            <a target="_blank" href="/assets/images/waitwait/reports-v320/panelist-vs-panelist-all-new.png">
            <img src="/assets/images/waitwait/reports-v320/panelist-vs-panelist-all-new.png" class="img-fluid border" alt="New version of the 'Panelist vs Panelist: All' report">
            </a>
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">
                New version of the "Panelist vs Panelist: All" report with collapsible sections for each panelist
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

In addition to the incorporation of the accordion component to reports, the presentation of certain data in tables have also received a few updates. The first update is the splitting of the "Best Of/Repeat" columns into a "Best Of" and a "Repeat Of" column. The "Best Of" column will only display a `True` if the value is true. The "Repeat Of" column now lists the original show date, which is linked to the corresponding show page on the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/).

The removal of displaying `False` for either of the columns helps reduce visual noise when scanning through tables for outliers.

### Wrapping Up

Information on the additional updates and changes included in version 3.2.0 of the [Wait Wait Reports Site](https://reports.wwdt.me/) is available in the project's [release notes](https://github.com/questionlp/reports.wwdt.me/releases/tag/v3.2.0) or in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/questionlp/reports.wwdt.me/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) file in the project's [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/questionlp/reports.wwdt.me).

In a future version of the Reports Site, I will be stripping out the code that checks for decimal panelist scoring columns in the database that was added for backwards compatibility. With the [Wait Wait Stats Database](https://github.com/questionlp/wwdtm_database) now stable at version 4.7 and values collected and entered into the respective columns, there is no longer a need to use the previous integer score-related columns.

If you would like to help support the Wait Wait Stats project, you can do so by [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/questionlp) or by [tipping me via Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/questionlp).
