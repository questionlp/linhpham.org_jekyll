With 2024 coming to a close, I wanted to provide a couple of updates from the past couple of months from the Wait Wait Stats Project and my continuing adventure into daily driving Linux.

Also, I'll include a sneak peek at what's coming up in the new year.

### Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! Shows for 1998-1999

Back in August 2023, I wrote about getting copies of the [Wait Wait Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org/) shows from 1998 and 1999. It took me through the end of November this year to listen through all of the available recordings. Unfortunately, the audio recording that I received for the 1998-05-23 show as for an NPR show called "Rock and Roll America" hosted by Richard Aquilla.

I will continue to go through my audio archive starting with 2000 in the new year. There is one show in which I do not have an audio recording for, 2000-01-08. I do not have a file for the 2000-01-01 show, but if the legacy NPR site is correct, the 2000-11-25 show is a repeat of the 2000-01-01 show.

At some point, I will try to reach out to NPR to see if there is any other way to get access to the audio for those three shows.

Photos of the notes that I have taken while listening to Wait Wait shows have been uploaded to the "[Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! Notes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/albums/72157718939162790)" album on Flickr.

### Wait Wait Stats Project Updates

There have been a couple of minor updates to the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) customizations shared by the [Wait Wait Graphs Site](https://graphs.wwdt.me/), [Wait Wait Reports Site](https://reports.wwdt.me/), and the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/). The responsive font sizes have been updated with slightly different scaling ratio and tweaked minimum and maximum sizes.

The Wait Wait Graphs Site also received an update to the [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) graphing library to bump the stable version to 2.35.3 and the v3 version to 3.0.0-rc.2.

### Updates on Using Fedora as My Daily Driver

It has been 6 months since I switched from using macOS on an 16-inch M1 Max MacBook Pro as my personal daily driver over to Fedora on a Framework Laptop 16. The laptop is still running the same install of Fedora since I started and it has been mostly smooth sailing.

More recent versions of the Linux kernel, starting with the later versions of 6.11 and currently with versions of 6.12, there have been some regressions in the AMD GPU drivers that cause more noticeable graphical glitches under certain circumstances. For now, I have pinned the kernel version to 6.12.4 as newer versions have some more significant regressions and bugs being reported on the [Fedora Discussions](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/) site.

I still use my MacBook Pro about an hour a week to backup RAW photos that I have taken on my iPhone and to sync music and podcasts to the same phone. [KDE Connect](https://apps.kde.org/kdeconnect/) has been incredible useful to allow file and photo transfers between the phone and my two laptops that run Fedora.

While I have used several free and open source image and photo editing programs (including [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)) in the past, I need to make an effort to learn how to use them more proficiently. For a couple of more complex images, I have used [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) as I am much more accustomed to the Adobe Photoshop-like interface. It would be incredible nice if there was an offline version of the web application that can be installed as a Flatpak application.

At this point in time, I don't plan on switching away from Fedora or migrating back to macOS for my daily driver. I have been experimenting with the alpha versions of [COSMIC DE](https://system76.com/cosmic/) installed via [Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ryanabx/cosmic-epoch/) on a spare laptop, but it still needs a lot of work and polish before I consider switching away from KDE Plasma.

For more information on the customizations and fixes that I have made for running Fedora on my Framework laptop, checkout my [framework-laptop-16](https://github.com/questionlp/framework-laptop-16) repository on GitHub.

### What's Next?

I have a blog post that I have started working on ranking video game console designs that was inspired by a video that [My Life in Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu0a9LG8XT4) published ranking the consoles that Coury and Try have in their collections.

On the topic of video game consoles, I've been thinking about writing up a post on a couple of emulation handheld consoles that I have using lately (as well as one or two that I'm waiting on).

Barring any unforseen circumstances, I will also be attending [PyCascades 2025](https://2025.pycascades.com/) at [Revolution Hall](https://www.revolutionhall.com/) in Portland, Oregon. If you will be attending in person, feel free to say "hello".

If you would like to contact me online, I am available on Mastodon as [@qlp@linh.social](https://linh.social/@qlp) and on Bluesky as [@linh.social](https://bsky.app/profile/linh.social).

I am no longer on Threads or Instagram. I will continue to post photos of my [Wait Wait Notes](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/albums/72157718939162790) and other photos to my [Flickr photostream](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/).
