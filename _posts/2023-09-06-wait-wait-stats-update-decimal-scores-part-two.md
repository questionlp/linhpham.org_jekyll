While I continue to listen to the Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! shows that aired in 1998, I ran across an episode where panelists would start the, then relatively now, Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank segment with half-points. Since I didn't account for that when I went through updating the `wwdtm` library and all of the Wait Wait Stats-related sites, I had to go back and make additional changes.

First, I had to add two new Wait Wait Stats Database columns in the `ww_showpnlmap` table: `panelistlrndstart_decimal` and `panelistlrndcorrect_decimal.` The two columns are defined as `decimal(10, 2)` and would mirror the corresponding `panelistlrndstart` and `panelistlrndcorrect` columns. Adding the new columns rather than redefining the original columns allows for backward compatibility.

After adding the new column and creating a script to copy over values, I updated the `wwdtm` library, [Wait Wait Stats API](https://api.wwdt.me/), [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/), and the [Wait Wait Reports](https://reports.wwdt.me/) site to utilize the new values.
