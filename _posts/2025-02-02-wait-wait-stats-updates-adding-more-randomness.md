Back in February 2021, I published a blog post title, "[That's So... Randomizer](https://blog.wwdt.me/2021/02/thats-so-randomizer/)", on the old [Wait Wait Stats Project Blog](https://blog.wwdt.me/) announcing a new feature I added to the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/) with the ability to view a random Not My Job guest, host, location, panelist, scorekeeper or show from the corresponding pages. In the same blog post, I mentioned that I would look at adding corresponding API endpoints to the [Wait Wait Stats API](https://api.wwdt.me/). Four years later, I guess it was finally time to add those API endpoints and a few other features to both the Stats Page and the Stats API.

### wwdtm Library Updates

To facilitate the new features and updates for both the Stats Page and the Stats API, the [wwdtm](https://github.com/questionlp/wwdtm) library was updated to add methods to retrieve base information, detailed information, ID and slug strings for random guests, hosts, locations, panelists, scorekeepers and shows.

The library also received updates to the `Location` class to provide means to retrieve postal abbreviations and their details. A bug where locations that have `NULL` set for the state column, causing those locations to not be included in location retrieval methods has been fixed. This fix is propagated to both the Stats Page and the Stats API.

Additional information on the changes and documentation on the API methods can be found in the [Changes document](https://docs.wwdt.me/latest/changes/index.html) on [docs.wwdt.me](https://docs.wwdt.me/).

### Stats Page Updates

With the code for retrieving random guests, hosts, locations, panelists, scorekeepers and shows being added to the `wwdtm` library, the Stats Page now references the corresponding methods and the previous code has been removed from the Stats Page codebase.

In addition to being able to get random shows across a set of all shows, there is now an ability to get a random show for a specific year. A "Random Show from" link is available when browsing a specific year's page. This new feature also makes use of updates made to the `wwdtm` library.

Additional information on other recent updates to the Stats Page can be found on GitHub under [stats.wwdt.me Releases](https://github.com/questionlp/stats.wwdt.me/releases).

### Wait Wait Stats Project Blog Updates

In the past couple of weeks, I have migrated the (inactive and now archived) Wait Wait Stats Project Blog, [blog.wwdt.me](https://blog.wwdt.me/), from being a self-hosted WordPress site to a statically generated site build using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

The reason for migrating away from WordPress is primarily driven by the recent actions taken by the current CEO of Automattic, and by reducing the system resources required to host a site that has been inactive (after I started posting Wait Wait Stats Project updates on this blog).
