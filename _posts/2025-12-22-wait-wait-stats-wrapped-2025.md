Last December, I published a series of Spotify Wrapped-inspired infographic images with a series of statistics for [Wait Wait Don't Tell Me!](https://waitwait.npr.org/) shows from 2024 called "[Wait Wait Stats Wrapped](https://linh.social/@qlp/113674878560177789)" on Mastodon and Instagram (I have since deleted my Instagram account). I also published the set of images to the "[Wait Wait Stats Wrapped 2024](https://www.flickr.com/photos/questionlp/albums/72177720322647930/)" album on Flickr.

For 2025, I made a couple of tweaks to the design of the infographic to only use full uppercase text in the title image, as well as removing the tilt of the titles on each subsequent image, to improve readability and reduce some of the harshness in the design. I also added several new sets of statistics, including:

* Hosts with the Most Appearances
* Scorekeepers with the Most Appearances
* Bluff the Listener vs Not My Job Guest Win Rate
* Not My Job Guest Statistics
