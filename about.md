Hello, my name is Linh Pham <span class="pronouns">he/him, they/them</span> and I am a Software Release Engineer for a global software solutions company and, in some circles, known as the "Wait Wait Stats Person" and the creator and maintainer of the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me).

### Work üè¢

As a Software Release Engineer, I help software development and product teams navigate through the software development lifecycle, project management workflows and change control processes to meet regulatory requirements.

I also work to create, document and manage workflows and standards specifically around software releases, and work with other groups in IT to ensure that the necessary people and resources are available to peer review and deploy the required changes.

Previously, I worked as a DevOps and TechOps Engineer and as an IT System Engineer, focusing on bare metal servers, virtualization, storage, monitoring, and automation of Windows and Linux servers.

### Coding üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

For software development projects and automation scripts, Python is my language of choice. In prior projects and jobs, I have also developed using C#, PHP and JavaScript.

For web development, I mainly focus on HTML and CSS, and dabble in both JavaScript and Ruby when needed.

### Projects ‚å®Ô∏è

### Computing üíª

Since getting my first home computer up through 2012, I had been a PC person, running everything from MS-DOS 5 through Windows 8.1, and some adventures into the world of OS/2, Sun Solaris, and short stint of using FreeBSD as a daily driver.

After Windows 8, I switched over to the world of Macs with several MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros running Mac OS X (now macOS).

In mid-2024, I made the jump from macOS over to Linux (I use [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), btw) full-time with a Framework Laptop 16 and a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 3. Although I do miss the efficiency of the Apple Silicon processors, I wanted to use something more open in terms of software and much better repairability and upgradability.

For servers, I had primarily used FreeBSD for almost everything at work and at home, though I would migrate over to Linux (first Ubuntu and now Debian).

### Video Games üéÆ

When I have some spare time, I will generally play video games launched in the late 1980s through late 1990s (mostly console with some PC/DOS games), along with a few consoles that have been released since.

Some of my favorite video games include:

* Bonk's Adventure
* Final Fantasy Adventure
* Final Fantasy VI
* Final Fantasy X
* Mega Man III
* SimCity 2000
* Super Mario Bros. 3
* Super Mario Maker 2
* Wing Commander: Privateer

Although I do try to play games on original console hardware wherever possible, but I have a collection of portable emulation consoles and FPGA-powered consoles, including a MiSTer.
