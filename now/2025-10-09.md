This is my "[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)".

## Where Am I?

Living on the west side of the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area.

## What Am I Working On?

The following are projects, tasks or hobbies that I am working on:

* Upgrading the [Wait Wait Stats Page](https://stats.wwdt.me/), [Graphs Site](https://graphs.wwdt.me/) and [Stats API](https://api.wwdt.me/) to use the latest version of the [Wait Wait Stats Library](https://github.com/questionlp/wwdtm)
* Researching ORMs (object relational mappers) to use for the next major versions of the Wait Wait Stats Project applications and libraries

## What Would I Like To Do Next?

I have a couple of things that I would like to spend time doing or trying out, in no particular order:

* Wipe and re-install macOS and Fedora Asahi Remix on my "old" M1 Max MacBook Pro
* Stand up a Forgejo instance as an option to migrate from GitHub
  * I considered migrating to Codeberg, but not all of my repositories and projects are free/open source and I would still need an instance for non-public repositories
* Give CachyOS a try on a spare laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 AMD)
* Replace the two Proxmox hosts running at home with something newer and more power efficient
* Port this blog over to Eleventy from Jekyll
