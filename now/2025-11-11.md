This is my "[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)".

## Where Am I?

Living on the west side of the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area.

## What I Had Been Working On?

The following are stuff that I recently finished working on:

* Upgrading my self-hosted [Umami Analytics](https://github.com/umami-software/umami) instance from version 2 to 3
  * Included migrating the database from MySQL to PostgreSQL
  * The database migration was not as simple as what their [database migration page](https://umami.is/docs/guides/migrate-mysql-postgresql) would lead you to believe
  * I [submitted a suggestion](https://github.com/umami-software/umami/discussions/3708) for an official migration script, or at least update their official docs
* Updated the [Wait Wait Graphs Site](https://graphs.wwdt.me/) with a new "[Recordings by State](https://graphs.wwdt.me/locations/recordings-by-state)" map

## What Am I Working On?

The following are projects, tasks or hobbies that I am working on:

* Buttoning down my Fedora Workstation 43 install with a handful of GNOME Extensions on both of my laptops
* Researching ORMs (object relational mappers) to use for the next major versions of the Wait Wait Stats Project applications and libraries

## What Would I Like To Do Next?

I have a couple of things that I would like to spend time doing or trying out, in no particular order:

* Stand up a Forgejo instance as an option to migrate from GitHub
  * I considered migrating to Codeberg, but not all of my repositories and projects are free/open source and I would still need an instance for non-public repositories
* Give CachyOS a try on a spare laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 AMD)
* Replace the two Proxmox hosts running at home with something newer and more power efficient
* Port this blog over to Eleventy from Jekyll
