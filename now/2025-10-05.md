This is my "[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)".

## Where Am I?

Living on the west side of the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area.

## What Am I Working On?

The following are projects, tasks or hobbies that I am working on:

* I have been working on testing compatibility of MariaDB 11.8 and 12.x for the [Wait Wait Stats Project](https://stats.wwdt.me/)
* Researching ORMs (object relational mappers) to use for the next major versions of the Wait Wait Stats Project applications and libraries

## What Would I Like To Do Next?

I have a couple of things that I would like to spend time doing or trying out:

* Wipe and re-install macOS and Fedora Asahi Remix on my "old" M1 Max MacBook Pro
* Give CachyOS a try on a spare laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 AMD)
* Replace the two Proxmox hosts running at home with something newer and more power efficient
* Port this blog over to Eleventy from Jekyll
