This is my "[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)".

## Where Am I?

Living on the west side of the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area.

## What I Had Been Working On?

The following are stuff that I recently finished working on:

* Upgrading the Ubuntu Server install on my personal Plex media server to 24.04 LTS
* Re-installed macOS on my Late 2016 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro after experimenting with Proxmox VE 9

## What Am I Working On?

The following are projects, tasks or hobbies that I am working on:

* Getting ready to create the 2025 edition of [Wait Wait Stats Wrapped](https://flickr.com/photos/questionlp/albums/72177720322647930/)
* Researching ORMs (object relational mappers) to use for the next major versions of the Wait Wait Stats Project applications and libraries
* Researching the process to potentially migrate the Wait Wait Stats Project from MySQL or MariaDB to PostgreSQL

## What Would I Like To Do Next?

I have a couple of things that I would like to spend time doing or trying out, in no particular order:

* Stand up a Forgejo instance as an option to migrate from GitHub
  * I considered migrating to Codeberg, but not all of my repositories and projects are free/open source and I would still need an instance for non-public repositories
* Give CachyOS a try on a spare laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 AMD)
* Replace the two Proxmox hosts running at home with something newer and more power efficient
* Port this blog over to Eleventy from Jekyll
