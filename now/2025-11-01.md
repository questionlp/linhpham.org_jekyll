This is my "[now page](https://nownownow.com/about)".

## Where Am I?

Living on the west side of the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area.

## What Am I Working On?

The following are projects, tasks or hobbies that I am working on:

* Switching from Fedora 42 KDE Plasma Desktop Edition to Fedora Workstation 43 with GNOME 49 on both my primary and travel laptops
  * I chose to switch from KDE Plasma to GNOME to get to spend more time using GNOME and spend less time trying to tweak and "rice" KDE Plasma
* Updating the [Wait Wait Graphs Site](https://graphs.wwdt.me) and [Wait Wait Reports Site](https://reports.wwdt.me/) sites to fix the "Panel Gender Mix" graph and report to properly account for shows with an all men panel (which just happened for the first time)
* Researching ORMs (object relational mappers) to use for the next major versions of the Wait Wait Stats Project applications and libraries

## What Would I Like To Do Next?

I have a couple of things that I would like to spend time doing or trying out, in no particular order:

* Stand up a Forgejo instance as an option to migrate from GitHub
  * I considered migrating to Codeberg, but not all of my repositories and projects are free/open source and I would still need an instance for non-public repositories
* Give CachyOS a try on a spare laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 2 AMD)
* Replace the two Proxmox hosts running at home with something newer and more power efficient
* Port this blog over to Eleventy from Jekyll
